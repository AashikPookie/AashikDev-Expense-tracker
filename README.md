# 💰 Expense Tracker - First Python Project

## 🎯 What This Is
My very first complete Python program! A console-based expense tracker built from scratch while learning programming basics.

## ✨ What It Does
• Add expenses with details (date, category, amount)
• View all your spending history
• Calculate total expenses
• Simple, clean console interface

## 🛠️ Built With
• Python 3
• Basic data structures (lists, dictionaries)
• Loops and conditionals
• Lots of debugging patience!

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Run the program
2. Choose options from menu
3. Track your daily expenses
4. See your spending patterns

## 💡 Why I Built This
To apply Python concepts I was learning and create something actually useful. Every developer remembers their first project - this is mine.

## 📈 What I Learned
• Turning concepts into working code
• Problem-solving when things break
• The importance of clean code structure
• How rewarding it feels to complete a project
